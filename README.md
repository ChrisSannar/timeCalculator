# timeCalculator

It is a calculator that simply tells the difference between two dates.

It's a basic program that I created after taking my first programming class. 
Sort of like a personal keystone project from everything that I learned

Anyway, feel free to look at it and have fun with it. The only issue that I'm trying to solve
is the mixing of times. That meaning that if you uncheck some of the boxes, I want to dates to
"squish" together.

For example, if you were to have the date difference of "1 year, 1 month, 1 day" and were to 
uncheck the "year" checkbox, it would be "0 years 13 months, 1 day". However, I have trouble
when I hit months due to the fact that our calendar year is pretty messed up (with leap year
and all the months that had to be maybe 30 or 31). Either way, that's what I'm working on.

Otherwise, Have fun! Put in your birthday and see how long you've been alive! I hope to 
develop a web version of this, but for now it's in Java as that is the code that I'm most 
familiar with.

Thanks for reading!
